# VoiceForge 🔊

> A modular Neural Voice AI platform for high-quality text-to-speech, voice cloning, and controllable speech generation.

VoiceForge is a production-oriented deep learning project focused on building modern speech synthesis systems from the ground up. The goal is to design a scalable architecture that mirrors real-world AI engineering workflows — from data pipelines to model training, inference, and deployment.

Rather than being a tutorial-style implementation, VoiceForge emphasizes clean structure, reproducibility, and engineering best practices used in professional ML environments.

* Neural Text-to-Speech using VITS-style architectures
* Multi-speaker speech synthesis
* Voice cloning
* Emotion and prosody control
* Real-time inference APIs
* Experiment tracking and model versioning
* Interactive web playground
